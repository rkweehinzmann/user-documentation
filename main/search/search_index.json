First of all: What is SciCat? And what are its features, how can I use it? SciCat, a science catalogue, should serve you to find back your data through its metadata. Genrally all datasets in SciCat are a priori datasets of metadata. In a further step, SciCat can handle access to the actual the experimental data. </p> <p>SciCat is a bookkeeping tool accompanying some critical steps during the entire data life cycle which are: getting an overview of datasets for data analysis, for re-analysis, for publishing datasets, and in particular for publication. </p> <p>SciCat has several strong points:</p> <ul> <li>It can be integrated to almost any other service that has REST APIs. Therefore, site-specific applications can be easily integrated. </li> <li>The Data Model of SciCat forsees a schemaless fields for quite different use cases. This concept has been implemented for the main class, Datasets, but is extended to function in the same way for the other classes e.g. Proposlas, Samples, Intstruments and Published Data.</li> <li>Its components are based on OpenSource software projects and state of the art technologies. </li> </ul> <p>For more detailed information on how to run scicat, see scicatlive documentation.
