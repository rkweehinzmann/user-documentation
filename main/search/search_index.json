Therefore, site-specific applications can be easily integrated. </li> <li>The Data Model of SciCat forsees a schemaless fields for quite different use cases. This concept has been implemented for the main class, Datasets, but is extended to function in the same way for the other classes e.g. Proposlas, Samples, Intstruments and Published Data.</li> <li>Its components are based on OpenSource software projects and state of the art technologies using MongoDB as backbone database, nestjs as backend basis. </li> </ul> <p>In the past 5 years SciCat has undergone major improvements in key areas for better user experience and re-structuring to meet the various different needs of photon science labs.

It can have several associated files attached which have the same metadata like a thumbnail or most common image files.</li> <li>Proposals: are used to link datasets to the proposal under which beamtime was granted.</li> <li>Instruments: Instruments is a library of instruments available at your institute, which can be linked to datasets.</li> <li>Samples: Here you can add metadata describing a physical sample which can be linked to it\u2019s experimental use captured in datasets. </li> </ol> <p>For many the SciCat datasets are the entry point to the catalogue, but soon it will be possible to start with samples or published data records (registered metadata sets).
