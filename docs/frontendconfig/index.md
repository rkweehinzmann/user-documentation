# Frontend configuration

In only two json files SciCat's frontend configuration is managed, both as part of the backend configuration:

1. [frontend.config.json](https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicat-backend-next/blob/master/src/config/frontend.config.json) and 
2. [frontend.theme.json](https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicat-backend-next/blob/master/src/config/frontend.theme.json)

Please write about
 - Why the frontend config is in the backend config?
 - What the scope is of these two files? 
 - Please provide examples for enabling/disabling buttons.
