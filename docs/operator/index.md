# Welcome to SciCat Manual for Admins

This is a short guide containing most of how SciCat can be operated. Many technical aspects are already described in the [scicatlive](https://www.scicatproject.org/scicatlive/latest/) documentation.

We highlight in more detail aspects for someone exploring core SciCat software. 

* How to set up development versions of the new version of [dataset endpoints](datasetsv4/index.md).
* How to configure SciCat to mint DOIs.
* How to integrate SciCat with other systems.
